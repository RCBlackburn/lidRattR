#### A package to be used in conjuction with lidR (https://github.com/Jean-Romain/lidR) that produces area-based varaibles for the voxel based approach. Additional scripts for cloud and tree-based approaches were used in Blackburn et al. 2021 (https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/cjfr-2020-0506). 

### Voxel-based apprach 

![](viz/voxel.gif)
This approach voxelizes the point cloud into desired resolutions and summarizes it a given area. 

```{r}
## install package and load library
devtools::install_github("RCBlackburn/lidRmts")
library(lidR)
library(lidRmts)
## read in example plot from lidR package
LASfile <- system.file("extdata", "Megaplot.laz", package="lidR")
las <- readLAS(LASfile)


las_vox <- vox(las, res = 2)
plot_metrics <- vox_sum(las_vox, 2)

## run function across larger las at a defined pixel resolution
v_metrics <- pixel_metrics(las_vox, func = .vox_raster, res = 20)


## plot output
plot(v_metrics)

```
