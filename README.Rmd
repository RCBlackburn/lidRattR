#### A package to be used in conjuction with lidR (https://github.com/Jean-Romain/lidR) that produces area-based varaibles. Newer function focus on the use of tree- and voxel-based variables. These appraoches are further outlines in Blackburn et al. 2021 (https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/cjfr-2020-0506). Below are some examples:

## Install package

```{r}
devtools::install_github("RCBlackburn/lidRmts")
```

## Load in library and example data from lidR package

```{r}
library(lidR)
library(lidRmts)
LASfile <- system.file("extdata", "Megaplot.laz", package="lidR")
las <- readLAS(LASfile)
```


## Tree-based approach

The tree based approach summarizes individual tree based information to a given area (e.g., plot, pixel).

First, We segment the trees using a tree segmentation function from lidR. Here, we use the Li et al. 2012 algorithm.

```{r}
las_tree <- segment_trees(las, li2012())
plot(las_tree, color = "treeID")
```

Next, we can turn the segmented tree point cloud into a tree attribute point cloud that can be used to summarize atributes to different extents. 

```{r}
las_tree <- ind_tree(las_tree)

## entire las summary statistics 
overall_t_metrics <- tree_sum(las_tree)
knitr::kable(overall_t_metrics)

## rasterized summary statistics 
tree_metrics <- pixel_metrics(las_tree, tree_sum_raster(Z, npoints, ca), res = 20)
plot(tree_metrics)
```

## Voxel-based approach

![](viz/voxel.gif)

The voxel-based approach voxelizes the point cloud and summarizes voxel information across a given area. This allows voxel-based variables to be assessed using an area-based approach. 

Using these functions, We produce a voxelized point cloud with indivdual voxel metrics and then summarize them to either the entire las or a raster with defined spatial resolution. 

```{r}
las_vox <- vox(las, res = 2)

## entire las summary statistics 
overall_v_metrics <- vox_sum(las_vox, 2)
knitr::kable(overall_v_metrics[c(1:4, 33)])

## rasterized summary statistics  
v_metrics <- pixel_metrics(las_vox, func = vox_sum_raster(SVi, FRDi, PDi, PDi_above), res = 20)
plot(v_metrics)
```
